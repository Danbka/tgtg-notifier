For a long time, I use [Too Good To Go](https://github.com/too-good-to-go) app for ordering food and make the planet greener.
But there is only one feature I need. It's a notification about appearing magic boxes in my favorite shops.
I researched TGTG app and found API endpoints that can help me :)

This app check shops I interested in and send telegram notification if box is available.
